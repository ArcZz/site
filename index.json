[{"content":"Self-introduction  About -- I am a driven, hard-working individual with an interest in work that allows me to find creative solution to problems. I will complete my master’s degree in computer science from NYU this spring and I have a bachelor’s degree from the University of Missouri-Columbia, also in computer science.\nMy primary interest in Computer Science was ignited when I took a computer class in high school. By learning how to develop a desktop calculator with VB language, it astonished me that the commonly-used software was developed by a series of codes. Out of great curiosity, I chose Software Engineering as my undergraduate major, which led me to step into the threshold of Computer Science.\nI am Zhi Zhang, a prospective Ph.D. student interested in Computational Biology. I have gained my master’s degree in Computer Science from New York University. And I have finished my undergraduate study at University of Missouri-Columbia (MU) and Taiyuan University of Technology with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Bachelor of Engineering in Software Engineering. I am now planning to pursue my Ph.D. degree in the USA, and excitedly find that your research on biology and medical science really inspires me.\nSee more in my CV.\nEducation  New York University (NYU) Master of Science in Computer Science\n2019 - 2021 \n University of Missouri-Columbia (MU) Bachelor of Science in Computer Science Cum Laude and Honors Scholar\n2015 - 2019 \n Taiyuan University of Technology (TYUT) Bachelor of Engineering in Software Engineering(2+2 Program in cooperation with MU)\n2013 - 2018 \n Skills   Programming Languages : JavaScript, Java, Python, PHP **Back-end Frameworks: ** Node.js, Java EE, Spark, Vaddin, Drupal 8 Frond-end Frameworks: HTML/CSS, React, Redux, Vue, Bootstrap, Material-UI, jQuery, Ajax, Json, EJS Others: Linux, Nginx, Apache, Unity3D, Git, Docker, Oracle, MATLAB, MySQL, MongoDB, Docker  Do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or inquiries.\n","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/about/","section":"Zhang, Zhi","summary":"Self-introduction  About -- I am a driven, hard-working individual with an interest in work that allows me to find creative solution to problems.","title":"About"},{"content":"If you would like to make an appointment:\n Click here to make an appointment  ","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/rdv/","section":"Zhang, Zhi","summary":"If you would like to make an appointment:","title":"Appointment"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories"},{"content":"For my contact details at UCLouvain, see my academic home page on uclouvain.be.\nFor anything else, contact me by email ✉\n","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/contact/","section":"Zhang, Zhi","summary":"For my contact details at UCLouvain, see my academic home page on uclouvain.","title":"Contact"},{"content":"Summary  motivation  Technical skills \u0026amp; languages  Software  Languages   Chinese (native) English (fluent)  Review CV  Download CV  ","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/cv/","section":"Zhang, Zhi","summary":"Summary  motivation  Technical skills \u0026amp; languages  Software  Languages   Chinese (native) English (fluent)  Review CV  Download CV  ","title":"CV"},{"content":"My research interests focus on bio-statistical methods applied to cancer patients.
