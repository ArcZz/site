[{"content":"Self-introduction  About -- I am a driven, hard-working individual with an interest in work that allows me to find creative solution to problems. I have gained my master’s degree in Computer Science from New York University. And I have finished my undergraduate study at University of Missouri-Columbia (MU) and Taiyuan University of Technology with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Bachelor of Engineering in Software Engineering.\nMy primary interest in Computer Science was ignited when I took a computer class in high school. By learning how to develop a desktop calculator with VB language, it astonished me that the commonly-used software was developed by a series of codes. Out of great curiosity, I chose Software Engineering as my undergraduate major, which led me to step into the threshold of Computer Science.\nSee more in my CV.\nEducation  New York University (NYU) Master of Science in Computer Science\n2019 - 2021 \n University of Missouri-Columbia (MU) Bachelor of Science in Computer Science Cum Laude and Honors Scholar\n2015 - 2019 \n Taiyuan University of Technology (TYUT) Bachelor of Engineering in Software Engineering(2+2 Program in cooperation with MU)\n2013 - 2018 \n Skills   Programming Languages : JavaScript, Java, Python, PHP Back-end Frameworks: Node.js, Java EE, Spark, Vaddin, Drupal 8 Frond-end Frameworks: HTML/CSS, React, Redux, Vue, Bootstrap, Material-UI, jQuery, Ajax, Json, EJS Others: Linux, Nginx, Apache, Unity3D, Git, Docker, Oracle, MATLAB, MySQL, MongoDB, Docker  ","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/about/","section":"Zhang, Zhi","summary":"Self-introduction  About -- I am a driven, hard-working individual with an interest in work that allows me to find creative solution to problems.","title":"About"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories"},{"content":"Languages   Chinese (native) English (fluent)  Review CV  Download CV  ","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/cv/","section":"Zhang, Zhi","summary":"Languages   Chinese (native) English (fluent)  Review CV  Download CV  ","title":"CV"},{"content":"RESEARCH ASSISTANTSHIP  FatPlants Web Portal, Digital Biology Lab Feb.2019-May 2019  Project Link: https://fatplants.net/homepage\n Participated in building the FatPlants web portal with analysis and visualization tools for plant fat-related genes, proteins and metabolism Achieved interactive network visualization using Cytoscape.js to illustrate gene ontology enrichment analysis  Plant Protein Phosphorylation Database Project, Digital Biology Lab  Project Link: http://www.p3db.org\n Participated in building a web resource portal for providing and analyzing protein phosphorylation data in plants for 45 species from ~260 in-vivo proteomic studies using Angular and MySQL Built protein sequence conservation analysis tools for inferring the importance of residues in a protein  Computational Biology Team, Stowers Institute for Medical Research   Developed independently a RNA-sequence data analysis module for differential gene expression analysis with various bioinformatics tools to organize and retrieve 21 lab experiment datasets, process user experiment request forms, and display laboratory data records, and streamlined lab processes by removing the need for manual processing / data entry Designed RESTful APIs in Express framework, used async/await to access data from 800+ files, and communicated with remote R shiny server to assist researchers in DiffExp/GO/Hearmaps analysis using different Fit model and FC/FDR cutoff parameters Created a responsive single-page application following material design guidelines to improve user experience and connected with LIMS to show more sample details for freeing analysts from repeated simple tasks  WORK EXPERIENCE  GritWorld  Software Developer Engineer\n Develop the web server and cloud-based service for next-generation computer graphics engine (GritGene) Develop high-concurrency and high-performance applications \u0026amp;
